    <h3>Cupcakes are a family affair at Cake Code.</h3>
    
    <p>Cake Code was founded in 1917 by Junith Code. In addition to specializing in bridal and event cakes, we also accommodate engagement parties, luncheon meetings, and baby showers. </p>
    <br>
    <p>We also serve freshly made-to-order gluten-free cakes, as well as a selection of other sweet, good stuff.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>While we have changed locations several times over the years, we have always worked to make sure our loyal customers near and far feel at home in our bakery.  Please feel free to stop in and meet our wonderful bakers and servers. Each one knows the menu inside out (we "force" them to try everything at least once) and would be happy to help you find your new favorite item.
    Additionally, some of our absolute favorite new additions to the menu have come from suggestions from customers! If there is a certain flavor or style of cupcake that you wished existed please let us know! We mostly likely will try it out. 
    This especially includes very restrictive dietary requirements. We enjoy the challenge of trying to meet the needs of our customers and find that we learn a lot along the way. This also goes for very unique parties or events.  If there is a very specific desert you have in mind, we look forward to trying to create it and hope that you will send us a picture of you and your family or friends enjoying it. </p>
